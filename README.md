# BleedingInDepth
[modpage](https://mods.vintagestory.at/bleedingindepth)

This mod introduces bleeding as a mechanic, allowing you more complex tactical decisions both before and during combat. Decide to keep fighting to have the chance to start tending to your bleed sooner or flee and hope you can escape in time to not bleed out! Choose different weapons for their damage types to utilize bleed more or go for direct damage (with compatible mods).

Highly configurable, you can change how pretty much all of the mod functions with just some config edits. I have put a lot of effort into balancing values to be fair but some may want more/less punishing or just to change up the system completely. with a bit of tinkering you could even make it a purely visual effects only mod! All config defaults are listed next to their config value so you can easily revert any config changes you make.
You can find my calculated default bleed output here if you are interested in the exact default values effects on damage and bleed: [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSgS3bJFIKTvSjLcBlhd_JhniNXM0MmVfNDR1lkLJ8KqWjpBzu3hHF38hi_wavI6ebhj2E4XNWnPkXd/pubhtml).
